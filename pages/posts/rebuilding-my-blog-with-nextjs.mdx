If you know me you probably have seen this website come through lots of redesigns, and with the same amount of blog posts. I don't write a lot in my blog, I mostly use it to experiment with new technologies. For example, the last transition, a couple years ago, was from WordPress to Jekyll and now I switched to Next.js.

## Why Next.js

With the rise of React and the SSR frameworks, e.g. Gatsby and Next.js, I saw a lot of good looking, fast blogs built with Gatsby. [You probably have already seen Dan's](https://overreacted.io/). Of course I went and tried to setup my own, but the thing I didn't like was that Gatsby blog-starter uses GraphQL, which is awesome, but I don't think I need that for a simple blog.

So with the bad habit I have of wanting to build my own version of everything, I went to build my own version of a blog-starter with Next.js.

## How

I got familiar with Next.js in the past few months by contributing an example and other small changes into the repo. I'm also currently building two products with it. So, I felt confident that I could build something decent for my use case.

### Checklist

I started with an empty project created with [create-next-app](https://github.com/segment-open-source-transfer/create-next-app) and from there I made a list of the features I needed.

1. How to create an object of posts from a list of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files
2. How to add syntax highlighting
3. How to I add an RSS feed
4. How to I add pagination

For a Next.js project, all these things were new for me and had no idea how to approach them. So, I went to investigate how other people are doing it.

Guillermo Rauch ([@rauchg](https://twitter.com/rauchg)) told me that Max Stoiber's site ([@mxstbr](https://twitter.com/mxstbr)) was one of his favorite blogs built with Next.js out there, so I looked at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mxstbr/mxstbr.com).

80% of the work was already done in Max's repository and I was fortunate to chat with him about it too. So, most of the credit for the work goes to him, his implementation is pretty clever and helped me a lot.

### 1. An `Object` of blog posts

To solve the first issue of my list, Max used the [babel-plugin-preval/macro](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-preval). This package lets you run Node code dynamically in a client context and exports the results.

Max used it to get the data from a list of MDX files, extract the metadata, and return an JavaScript `Object` that we can use in our Next.js app.

### 2. Syntax highlighting

It got trickier to solve the second item on the list. I was able to get syntax highlighting working with [rehype-prism](https://github.com/mapbox/rehype-prism), but one key feature was missing. The ability to highlight a line of code.

/>

This was probably the hardest part of the process. To implement this I went to a rabbit hole of learning about [unified.js](https://unified.js.org/) and how syntax trees work. I had to understand how the Gatsby team and contributors implemented their own and how to plug it into the MDX plugin interface.

I had to <s>steal code</s> get inspiration from these packages:

- [gatsby-remark-prismjs](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs)
- [@mapbox/rehype-prism](https://github.com/mapbox/rehype-prism)
- [refractor](https://github.com/wooorm/refractor)

I won't go in detail, but I integrated code from those three packages to get syntax highlighting working along with the line highlighting feature. There are other features that are missing but this will do it for now.

### 3. RSS feed

This was easy. I followed Max's lead of using the [JSON feed spec](https://jsonfeed.org/) and reformatting the blog posts `Object` from the first item of the list into a JSON RSS feed.

I still haven't figure out how to create the JSON file on build time, so for now I'm running the [node script](https://github.com/j0lv3r4/jolvera.dev/blob/master/posts/rss-feed.js) before commiting the changes to generate the feed and [routing it as a static file](https://github.com/j0lv3r4/jolvera.dev/blob/master/now.json#L7).

### 4. Pagination

This was easy, too. I used the [pagination library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pagination) with the [blog posts `Object`'s length and other options as input](https://github.com/j0lv3r4/jolvera.dev/blob/master/pages/blog.js#L13-L18).

After all this I got the project into a good-enough working blog using Next.js, at this point I was really excited to have it deployed and that [Saturday night I decided to launch it using Now 2.0](https://twitter.com/_jolvera/status/1127431569042550784?s=20).

## Development environment

One of the benefits of using Next.js with Now 2.0 is the new [`now dev`](https://zeit.co/blog/now-dev) command. You get to see exactly what you will get in production. It uses the same `now.json` configuration file and pretty much everything else works the same way.

All the work felt easier than it should.

## Conclusion

The website feels really fast. The [Lighthouse audit](https://twitter.com/_jolvera/status/1127432136565383169?s=20) results are amazing. The easiness of adding content feels as if you were dealing with a CMS, except there's no login.

The SSR and pre-fetching features Next.js provides makes the site feel very smooth, fast and responsive.

So far I'm very happy with the experience of developing with Next.js and Now and the results speak for themselves. [I already submitted a work-in-progress PR](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/7002) to the Next.js repository to add the blog as an example, and I hope somebody will find this work useful as I found Max's.
